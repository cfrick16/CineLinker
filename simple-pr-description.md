# Add GitHub Actions CI/CD Integration

## What's Changed

- Added three GitHub Actions workflows:
  - Development deployment (triggers on develop/feature branches)
  - Production deployment (triggers on main/master branches and version tags)
  - Pull request validation (runs on PRs to main branches)
- Added documentation in `.github/README.md`
- Updated main README with CI/CD information

## Benefits

- Automated builds, tests, and deployments
- Consistent deployment process across environments
- Improved code quality through automated PR checks
- Simplified release process with automatic GitHub releases

## Required Setup

Repository secrets need to be configured for deployment credentials.
